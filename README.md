# Video-Server

Personal Video Server for uploading and streaming videos on local network.

Utilizes Socket.io-stream, Node.js, and Javascript.

Plan is to run it off of Raspberry Pi and host webpage off of the Pi's IP.


NOTE: need to add "videos" directory in base directory or there will be errors. 
      Problem will exist until I find time to make a fix.
